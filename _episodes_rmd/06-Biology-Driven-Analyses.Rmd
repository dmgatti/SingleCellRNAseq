teaching: 10
exercises: 2
questions:
- "What are some scRNA-Seq analyses that might provide me with biological insight?"
objectives:
- "Understand the ability (and limitations) of scRNA-Seq data for quantifying differences in gene expression and tissue cell composition."
- "Be able to articulate the concept of pseudotime."

## Differential expression 

Looking for differential expression can be thought of as 

## Pathway enrichment 

## Differences in cell composition 

## Cell-cell communication 

## Pseudotime
