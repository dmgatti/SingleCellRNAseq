### Differences in cell composition

Single cell transcriptomics is a very powerful method for identifying
differences in tissue cell composition. This sort of question was 
usually addressed using methods like flow cytometry in the past, but flow
cytometry requires knowing what you want to look for before you can
quantify it. In scRNA-Seq we can take an entirely unbiased view of cell
composition, and we can define cell subsets with more subtle changes in
gene expression as opposed to only looking at broad classes of cell types.

### Cell-cell communication 

An analysis of possible cell-cell communication is one output that
can be inferred from scRNA-Seq data. The basic idea is that we can 
use databases of known receptor-ligand interactions in order to 
predict cells that interact. Specifically, if cell type A expresses ligand X,
and cell type B expresses the cognate receptor for ligand X, we can infer
the possibility of communication between these two cell types.
Of course scRNA-Seq data is not telling us whether that 
receptor-ligand link is actually *active* at any particular moment in time,
but it may be useful to understand which cells are communicating
most/least and how lines of communication change in, say, a 
drug-treated vs control condition.

### Pseudotime and velocity

What is pseudotime

*slingshot*

There are many, many algorithms and software packages for inferring 
pseudotime. For a very nice list check out
[Anthony Gitter's github list](https://github.com/agitter/single-cell-pseudotime).
