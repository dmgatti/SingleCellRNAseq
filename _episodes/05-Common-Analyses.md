## Normalization (log and more specialized) 


~~~
liver_iv <- NormalizeData(liver_iv, normalization.method = "LogNormalize") %>% 
            FindVariableFeatures(nfeatures = 2000) %>% 
            ScaleData(vars.to.regress = c("percent.mt", "nCount_RNA")) %>%
            RunPCA(verbose = FALSE, npcs = 100)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in NormalizeData(liver_iv, normalization.method = "LogNormalize") %>% : could not find function "%>%"
~~~
{: .error}

## Dimensionality reduction (UMAP, tSNE, etc) 

## Clustering 


~~~
ElbowPlot(liver_iv, ndims = 100) + geom_vline(xintercept = 27)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in Stdev(object = object, reduction = reduction): object 'liver_iv' not found
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
num_pc <- 27
liver <- FindNeighbors(liver_iv, reduction = 'pca', 
                       dims = 1:num_pc, verbose = FALSE) %>%
           FindClusters(verbose = FALSE, resolution = 0.8) %>%
           RunUMAP(reduction = 'pca', dims = 1:num_pc, verbose = FALSE)
~~~

Error in FindNeighbors(liver_iv, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:num_pc, verbose = FALSE) %>% : could not find function "%>%"

## Annotating cell types (+ automated options e.g. SingleR) 

## Finding marker genes 

## Discussion of data visualization, sample of common plots
