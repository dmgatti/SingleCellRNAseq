## Brief overview of technology 


## Compare and contrast with bulk RNA-Seq 

- tissues are heterogeneous mixtures of diverse cell types.
- bulk RNA-seq measures average gene expression across diverse cell types.
- may be difficult to tell whether gene expression or cell populations are changing.

## What is scRNA-Seq useful for? 

- devleopmental studies.
- hematopoeisis.
- detailed tissue atlas.
- tumor clonality.

## Emphasize focus of this course: 10X Genomics, mouse

While there are several commercially available scRNA-seq technologies, this course will focus on data generated by the 10X Genomics platform. We will also focus on a mouse data set and note that most of the techniques that you will learn in this workshop apply to other species as well.
